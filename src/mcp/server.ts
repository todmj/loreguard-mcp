 * R1 — MCP server. Stdio transport only (no network listener). Three
 * tools exposed to the client:
 *
 *   - search_lore  — brief-by-default; default-filtered to active records,
 *                    excludes drafts/deprecated/superseded/restricted unless
 *                    explicitly opted in via flags. The token-saving entry.
 *   - get_lore     — full body of one record by id. Use this AFTER a
 *                    search hit to spend tokens on detail only when needed.
 *   - suggest_lore — agent-authored knowledge lands as a DRAFT
 *                    (status='draft'). Hidden from default search until
 *                    a human runs `loreguard approve <id>`. Agents cannot
 *                    promote their own records.
 *
 * Every tool call is recorded to `~/.loreguard/audit.jsonl` with the request
 * args, result count, and result ids — never the full result bodies.
