/**
 * MCP input-length guards for fields that have a hard cap but used to
 * fail through zod's `.max()` validator. The zod path surfaced
 * "body is undefined" upstream when summary parse failed — the actual
 * cause was masked and agents gave up silently. These helpers replace
 * that with an actionable JSON response the agent can correct against
 * without a human round-trip:
 *
 *     { error: "summary_too_long", provided: 812, max: 800,
 *       suggested_cut: "<800-char truncation ending in '…'>",
 *       hint: "Retry with a shorter summary; body has no length limit." }
 *
 * Body length is deliberately uncapped — body is not returned in search
 * hits, only via `get_lore` on demand, so cost is opt-in. The cap on
 * title and summary protects the search-result payload size every
 * agent call pays for.
