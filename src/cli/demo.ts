/**
 * `loreguard demo` — seed a handful of realistic-but-clearly-illustrative
 * records so a new user can try `list`, `search`, and `review` without
 * having to think up content. Safety constraints:
 *
 *   - refuses to seed into a non-empty DB unless `--force`
 *   - every record carries the `demo` tag so `loreguard demo --clean` can
 *     undo the seed without touching real lore
 *   - no fake credentials, no fake PII, nothing that looks plausibly
 *     sensitive
 *   - includes one draft so the review-flow is visible without users
 *     having to wire up the MCP server first
 *   - one record is intentionally stale (review_after in the past) so
 *     the `stale: true` warning is observable
